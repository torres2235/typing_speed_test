# Typing Speed Test

Test your typing speed (WPM) and accuracy with this Python GUI application!

## Details
Typing speed is measured by the number of words you can type correctly in a set amount of time. A “word” is equivalent to five keystrokes. During a test, both speed and accuracy are measured. You will receive a number that indicates your average words per minute (WPM) and a percentage that indicates your accuracy.
